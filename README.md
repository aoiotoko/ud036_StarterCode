## How to run the program:
Python 2.7 must be installed in your computer. Download and Installation instructions for Python can be found at [https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org). 

After Python 2.7 is installed, download the file called "movie-trailer-website-project.zip" [https://github.com/aoiotoko/ud036_StarterCode](here) . Once downloaded, extract all the files.
Use the Python 2.7 shell to open the file 'entertainment_center.py' and then press F5 on the keyboard to run the file. The website will then be created and shown in the default browser. Any modern browser will display the site correctly, however, it may not work properly in Internet Explorer.
